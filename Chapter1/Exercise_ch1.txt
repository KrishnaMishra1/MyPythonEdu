1. Which of the following are operators and which are values?
Ans.Operators: *,-,/,+
values: 'hello', -88.8, 5

2. spam is a variale and 'spam' is a string

3. 3 different data types: Integer, Floating point and String data types

4. Concatenation operator:
'Alice' +'Bob' = 'AliceBob'

'Alice' * 5 = 'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'

5. variable names rules:
1. It can be only one word.
2. It can use only letters, numbers and the underscore character.
3. It can't begin with a number.

a. variable names are case sensitive
b. it uses camel case

6. myName = input()  ## to input an value to a variable
7. len()  ## length of the value

8. Print statement

print('You will be' +str(int(Age)+1) + 'in a year.')

9. Comments

# This program says hello and asks for my name

10. Python ignores the blank line after the comment. we can add as many blank lines to our program. 
This can make our code easier to raed, like paragraphs in a book. 

11. The Str(), int() and float() functions

the str(), int() and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, and floating-point forms
of the value you pass respectively.

The int() function is also useful if you need to round a floating-point number down.

int(7.7) = 7

42 == '42' FALSE

42 == 42.0 TRUE

42.0 == 0042.00 TRUE

Python makes this distinction because strings are text, while integers and floats are both numbers.

12. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Expressions consist of values and operators and they can always evaluate down to a single value.
A single value with no operators is also considered an expresssion. 

13. Expression and a statement
expression = programming instruction

14. Bacon = 20
Bacon+1

output = Bacon = 21

15. 'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'

'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'

16. eggs is a lowercase letter, 100 is a digit

17. int(), float() and str()

18. 'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos.'
I have eaten 99 burritos.
