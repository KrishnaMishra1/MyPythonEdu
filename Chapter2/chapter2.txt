1.Boolean values : True or False
2. Comparison Operators : compare 2 values. == and != operators work with values of any data type, 
where as <, >, <= and >= operators work properly with integer and floating point values.
3. Boolean Operators: and, or, not. 
4. Elements of flow chart: Conditions, Blocks of code
5. if, elif, else
if condition:
else:
elif condition:

6. while loop statement
while condition:
7. break staement
if the execution reaches a break stement, it immediately exits the while loop's clause.
8.continue statement:
these staements are inside the loop. when the program execution reaches a continue statement,
the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevelauates the loop's condition.
9. for loop and the range() function
for i in range(5):
	print(i)

it will print 0,1,2,3,4
it sets from 0

break and continue statement can be written inside for and while loop.

10. starting, stopping and stepping in range

range(starting, stopping, stepping)

11. Importing modules:
import keyword
the name of the module
optionally, more module names, as long as they are separated by commas

import math
import random, sys, os

12. Ending a program early with sys.exit()
the program can be terminated or exited by calling the sys.exit() function.

Practice questions:
1. True and False 
2.or, and , not
3. TT,TF,FT,FF
and 1,0,0,0
or 1,1,1,0
4. F, F, T, F,F,T
5. ==,<,<=,>,>=,!=
6. condition : a flow control statement. it always evaluate T or F.in If elif and while statement
7. == and =
9. spam = input()
if spam == 1:
	print("Hello")
	elif spam == 2:
		print("howdy")
		else:
			print("Greetings")
10. escape

11.Break exit from the loop. continue reevaluate the condition
12. start, strat and stop, strat , stop and step
13. for i in range(10):
	print(i+1)
i = 0
while i<10:
	print(i+1)

14. import spam sp
sp.bacon()
