Lists:
list data types and tuples

list and tuples can contain multiple values, which makes it easier to write programs that handle large amounts of data.

1. The List DataType:
A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence.
list value refers to the list itself, not the values inside te list value.
A list begins with an openeing square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket.
Values inside the list are also called items.
items are separated with commas.

The value[] is an empty list taht contains no values, similar to ' ', the empty string.

2. Getting Individual Values in a list with indexes:
spam = ["1","2","3","4"]

spam[0] = '1'

3. Lists can also contain other list values.

spam = [['cat','bat'],[10,20,30,40]]

spam[0] = ['cat', 'bat']
spam[0][1] = 'bat'

spam[1][3] = 40 

4. Negative Indexes

the negative 1, -1, refers to the last index in a list.

spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'mat']

spam[-1] = 'mat'

4. Getting Sublists with Slices
Just as an index can get a single value from a list, a slice can get several values from the lsit, in the form of a new list.

A slice is typed between square brackets, like an index, but it has 2 integers separated by a colon.

spam[2] is a list with an index 2 (one integer)
spam[1:4] is a list with a slice (two integers)

A slice goes up to, but will not include, the value at the second index.

spam = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

spam[0:4] = [1,2,3,4]

5. Shortcut:
Leaving out first index is same as 0 or the beginning of the list.
Leaving the second index is the same as using the length of the list, which will slice to the end of the list.

spam[:2] = [1,2]
spam[4:]=[5,6]

spam[:] = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

6. Getting a List's Length with len()
/
